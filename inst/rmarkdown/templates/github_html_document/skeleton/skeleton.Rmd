## Github-themed HTML documents

This template produces an HTML document that uses a similar style as the one 
applied to markdown files on Github. (Ultimately, `github_html_document` is 
just a wrapper for `rmarkdown::html_document` but it uses a Github-themed CSS
style file.) 

Unlike Github-flavored markdown files, these HTML files can render Mathjax 
equations: $y = mx + b$.

The usual RMarkdown boilerplate is included below.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for
authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown
see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes
both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the
document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent
printing of the R code that generated the plot.
