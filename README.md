ghdown
======

The goal of ghdown is to create Github-styled HTML documents from RMarkdown

Installation
------------

You can install ghdown from Github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tjmahr/ghdown")
```

Example
-------

`github_html_document()` is just a wrapper for `rmarkdown::html_document()` but it uses the Github-themed CSS style file.

You can use the format in `render()`.

``` r
rmarkdown::render(
  input = "./README.Rmd", 
  output_format = ghdown::github_html_document(),
  output_file = "./inst/README.html")
```

The resulting HTML file can be [previewed here](https://rawgit.com/tjmahr/ghdown/master/inst/README.html). It looks like the HTML preview generated by `rmarkdown::github_document()`. That's the point of the package.

One upside of targeting HTML is MathJax support. This equation renders correctly in the HTML preview of this document.

YAML Example
------------

This format can be targeted like other formats in the YAML frontmatter. Like so:

``` yaml
---
output:
  ghdown::github_html_document: default
---
```

Any options set in the YAML frontmatter as passed onto `rmarkdown::html_document()`.
